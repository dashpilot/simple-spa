# simple-spa
Simple single-page app written in vanilla js

## About
Tired of compilers, build-scripts, dependancy hell and `npm audit fix`? This refreshingly simple Single Page App (SPA) has exactly one dependancy (handlebars), no shadow dom or build pipelines and does just enough to be useful.

Simple SPA also runs in environments that do not support Nodejs such as Object Storage or shared hosting and can be edited on the fly without waiting for a compiler or a build pipeline.
